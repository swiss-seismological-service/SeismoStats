# What is SeismoStats?

SeismoStats is a library for statistical analysis of seismicity. It aims to provide a user friendly way to analyse seismic catalogs, with reliable and documented methods. The library provides a {doc}`../reference/formats/catalog` object, as well as routines to compute the statistical parameters as well as plot the seismicity catalogs and their statistical features.

If you feel that anything essential is missing, feel free to open an issue or to contribute (https://github.com/swiss-seismological-service/SeismoStats). This is thought to be a continuously growing community driven effort.

Please cite the corresponding article, in which the fundamentals of the software are described in detail.
